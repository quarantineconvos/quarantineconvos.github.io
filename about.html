        <h1> About Us </h1>

        <p>
            The best part about social media is how it provided a voice to everyone. However, the increased frequency at which people produce content has also resulted in a flood of spontaneous garbage. As a platform open to all, Quarantine Conversations aims to publish content that is somewhat better prepared than the average 90 second tweet. Hopefully, the platform will be able to foster some healthy exchanges of ideas and thought-provoking discourses.
