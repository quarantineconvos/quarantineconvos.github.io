        <p class="basicp">
            &emsp;&emsp;Quarantine Conversations is a website made and maintained by four high school kids who are bored from the quarantine. The website features articles on a variety of topics written by readers like you. Want to write an article and see it published here? We'd accept almost anything.
        </p>
        <h1 style="float: center"> "Rules," and how to submit </h1>
        <p class="basicp">
            &emsp;&emsp;1. There are no content based restrictions. The article can be about anything within reason. You can share experiences and hobbies, argue opinions and viewpoints, or shed light on unfamiliar topics. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;2. Soft length restriction of 500-1500 words. If it's somewhat shorter but serves the purpose, go for it. This is only to prompt more "complete" and perhaps higher quality content. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;3. If you have an opinion (movie reviews, social issues, and especially anything political), make sure that your argument is sound. We won't shoot down any articles based on political beliefs, but they have to be logical and comprehensible. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;4. To submit what you wrote, email it as a document/pdf to conversationsq@gmail.com <br><br>
In the email, include a title and subtitle and whether if you'd like your name to be displayed as the author (if so, include your name too), use a nickname, or remain anonymous.
You can choose to include a thumbnail for your post, otherwise we can find an appropriate one for you. You can also include pictures in your article, just put them in the document/pdf. Finally, make sure that all images are SFW.
